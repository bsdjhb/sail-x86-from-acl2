# Original Documentation

This directory contains documentation of the original prototype of the translator written by Patrick Taylor, in particular Patrick's dissertation in `doc/diss/latex/diss.pdf`.  Much of this still applies to the current version of the translator, but it has not been kept up to date with the development of the translator, and some aspects have changed;  for example, the type inference now generates fixed-width bitvector type annotations where possible, rather than using unbounded integers.

We keep this original documentation for reference.  Apart from the dissertation, it also includes:

* `SpecialCases.md` - contains a list of places in the code which might cause confusion.
* `FutureWork.md` - contains a list of obvious improvements which could be made.
* `ImplementationNotes.md` - contains comments on implementation details and thoughts on how to extend the translator.
* `comparison/` - contains a side by side comparison of an ACL2 call trace and its Sail translation (generated by the original prototype of the translator) along with explanatory prose.  There are also tips about how to navigate the ACL2 codebase.

Outside this directory, there is also the file `../translator/validation/Readme.md`, which describes how to use the translated model, as well as code comments at the start of each Python file and function in `../translator`.
